- 👋 Hi, I’m @simcax
- 👀 I’m interested Raspberry Pi, Kubernetes, Flask, Cockroach DB - building webapps, where I dabble in scalability and infrastructure
- 🌱 In my homelab I have an AMD64 Kubernetes cluster based on Talos Linux as well as a Raspberry Pi kubernetes cluster, based on Microk8s. I sometime blog about it here: [skov.codes](https://www.skov.codes)
- I hope to be able to give back to the community. Right now looking into kcli 
- 📫 I can be reached by e-mail: carsten@skov.codes
